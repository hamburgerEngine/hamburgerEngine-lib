# hamburger engine - Formerly known as Phlox Engine

hamburger engine is a C++ game engine built with SDL2.

This is all being done by one person so development may be slow.

The required libraries are already included because I don't wanna keep redownloading them whenever I decide to reinstall Windows.

The .nsp file in the docs folder is a forwarder for the switch version by the way, make sure hamburger-engine.nro is in:

```
/switch/hamburgerEngine/hamburger-engine.nro
```
